# Ethical-Analysis-of-Large-Language-Models-LLMs

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to investigate biases present in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their outputs across various demographic groups or ethical scenarios. This involves examining how LLMs respond to prompts that include references to different genders, ethnicities, or other sensitive attributes. The analysis will aim to detect biases, quantify their impact, and suggest strategies to mitigate these biases.

## Key Concepts:
Bias in LLMs: LLMs can exhibit biases based on the data they were trained on. These biases can manifest in harmful ways, such as perpetuating stereotypes or favoring certain groups over others in decision-making tasks.

Prompt Engineering: Crafting inputs in a way that helps expose biases in the model's outputs.

Quantification of Bias: Metrics such as the disparity in positive/negative sentiment, differences in generated content, or unequal treatment of different demographic categories.

## Step 1: Set Up Environment

Python is typically used for this type of project, leveraging frameworks like Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers to interact with LLMs. We'll use GPT models from OpenAI. 

## Step 2: Load the Pretrained LLM

we use OpenAI's GPT models via Hugging Face's transformers library.

## Step 3: Define the Prompts for Bias Detection

design prompt templates that include references to sensitive topics such as gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. These prompts will help in examining the biases in model responses.

Example Prompts:

Gender-based prompts: "The doctor is [MASK], and [MASK] did a great job."

Ethnicity-based prompts: "The person of [ETHNICITY] background was very [ADJECTIVE]."
