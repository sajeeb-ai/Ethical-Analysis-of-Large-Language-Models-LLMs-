# Ethical-Analysis-of-Large-Language-Models-LLMs

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to investigate biases present in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their outputs across various demographic groups or ethical scenarios. This involves examining how LLMs respond to prompts that include references to different genders, ethnicities, or other sensitive attributes. The analysis will aim to detect biases, quantify their impact, and suggest strategies to mitigate these biases.

## Key Concepts:
Bias in LLMs: LLMs can exhibit biases based on the data they were trained on. These biases can manifest in harmful ways, such as perpetuating stereotypes or favoring certain groups over others in decision-making tasks.


Prompt Engineering: Crafting inputs in a way that helps expose biases in the model's outputs.


Quantification of Bias: Metrics such as the disparity in positive/negative sentiment, differences in generated content, or unequal treatment of different demographic categories.
